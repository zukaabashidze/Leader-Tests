        <p style="font-size: large;"> I received a job offer mid-course,  <br> and the subjects I learned were current, <br> if not more so, 
            in the company I joined.  <br> I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.
          </p>
        <p style="color: rgb(164, 192, 192);font-size: large;"> “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. <br>
             I’ve been looking to make a <br>
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up <br>
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. <br>
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing <br>
            the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ” <br></p>

        Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.<br>
         Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.<br>
    </P>
<p>

    “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing.<br>
    The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. <br>
    The standard is above the rest.<br>
    You will get the personal attention you need from <br>
    an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”<br>

    <p>
        Such a life-changing experience.<br> Highly recommended!
    </p>
    <p>
        “ Before joining the bootcamp,<br> 
         I’ve never written a line of code. <br> 
         I needed some structure from <br> 
        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. <br> 
         I was encouraged to enroll by a former <br> 
        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.<br> 
         The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint<br> .
         They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.<br> 
          The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. <br> 
          It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. <br> 
          In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. <br> 
          It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. <br> 
          100% recommend! ”<br>
